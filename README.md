## Model Quantization Example
This repository provides a demonstration of model quantization in machine learning, showcasing how to enhance efficiency and reduce memory usage while maintaining model accuracy.

# Introduction
Model quantization is a powerful technique in machine learning that involves reducing the precision of the model's parameters (weights and activations). By doing so, we can significantly decrease the memory requirements and computational complexity of the model, making it more efficient for deployment on various devices, especially those with limited resources. 

In this example, we'll explore how to quantize a simple logistic regression model and observe the impact on model performance and efficiency.

# Results
We compare the accuracy of the original model versus the quantized model.
We observe the reduction in memory usage and discuss the implications of quantization on model inference time.
